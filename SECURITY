= Making Your Thumbslug Connections Secure =

Thumbslug should be run with all SSL options turned on. If you are running
Thumbslug and Candlepin on the same system, you could run that connection
without SSL, but do so with caution.

An overview of the different communication paths, and each side verifies
identity (communication is assumed to be secure by virtue of using SSL):

 * _Client to Thumbslug_: Thumbslug runs this SSL connection with a certificate
   signed by a CA that is configured on the client, allowing the client to
   verify the server's identity (ssl.keystore). Thumbslug verifies that the
   client certificate is valid both by checking that it has been signed by a
   known CA (ssl.ca.keystore), and by confirming that Candlepin knows about the
   provided certificate (which covers revocation).
 
 * _Thumbslug to Candlepin_: No certificate verification is done on either side.
   However, since OAuth is used for communication, both sides verify each
   other's identity by virtue of a shared secret.
 
 * _Thumbslug to CDN_: Thumbslug makes the CDN request using the entitlement
   certificate it gets from Candlepin. This certificate has been signed by the
   upstream CA that is paired with the CDN, so the CDN is able to verify it.
   The CDN also checks a CRL to make sure the certificate is still valid.
   Thumbslug verifies the identity of the CDN by checking that its certificate
   is signed by a known CA (cdn.ssl.ca.keystore).

Additionally, typical content that the client consumes (RPMS), are signed with
a GPG key.

Except when examining the two entitlement certificates, no revocations are
considered.

No hostname checks are done against any certificates.

No certificates are considered valid if they are outside of their not
before/not after periods.
