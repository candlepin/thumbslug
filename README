== What? ==

Thumbslug is a content/entitlement proxy. It lets your candlepin clients access
content from the upstream cdn using locally granted entitlement certificates.

== How? ==

To run from source, use `buildr serve`,
or `java -jar target/thumbslug-1.0.0.jar`

If you've installed via the rpm, you can run it as a regular system service, using 'service' or 'chkconfig'.

== Initial Configuration ==

You'll need to do a bit of setup first, before thumbslug will work.
 - Create a pkcs keystore containing a cert/private key for thumbslug to use
   to talk to its clients, and sign it with a CA that your clients will know.
   Place this keystore in /etc/thumbslug/server_keystore.p12
   - Example: keytool -genkeypair -alias my_certificate -keystore /etc/thumbslug/server_keystore.p12 -storepass thumbslug -validity 365 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype pkcs12
 - set the value of ssl.keystore.password in /etc/thumbslug/thumbslug.conf to
   match the password on the above keystore.
 - Set up a shared secret betweeen candlepin and thumbslug.
   In /etc/candlepin/candlepin.conf, set
   candlepin.auth.oauth.consumer.thumbslug.secret = <SECRET>
   In /etc/thumbslug/thumbslug.conf, set
   candlepin.oauth.secret = <SECRET>
 - copy your candlepin's CA cert (what your entitlement certs are signed with)
   to /etc/thumbslug/client-ca.pem

That's it!

This assumes your candlepin is running on the same host as thumbslug. If that's
not the case, you'll need to set some more config values. Check the 'Config
Options' section below, and the contents of /etc/thumbslug/thumbslug.conf.

You'll also have to configure your clients to talk to thumbslug. set baseurl in
rhsm.conf to match your thumbslug host/port, and repo_ca_cert to match your
thumbslug's CA cert.

== logging properties ==

Logging levels and properties can be set at runtime in the thumbslug.conf.

For ex:

log4j.logger.org.candlepin.thumbslug=INFO
log4j.logger.org.candlepin.thumbslug.HttpRequestHandler=DEBUG
