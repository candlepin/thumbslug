# Thumbslug needs a lot of SSL certs in place for spec testing.
# Rather than generate them at test time, we have them stored in the repo.

You will also need an entitlement cert that represents the consumer. I have
not found an easy way of creating this cert given all the custom extensions
that we use. However, when I created the entitlement cert we use for testing
I set it to last until 2030. Hopefully that will be long enough.

If you have to do it again, here is what I did:
1. Hack Candlepin to issue entitlement certs that last a very long time
   because you don't want to do this often. I made the change in
   DefaultEntitlementServiceAdapter where we make a call to PKIUtility's
   createX509Certificate() method. Just pass in a very long time from now
   as the cert end date.
2. Hack Candlepin's CA to last a very long time as well, because why not?
   We have a script called gen-certs that does all this for us, but for
   completeness, here is the relevant portion with the -days argument set
   for 20 years.

   CERTS_HOME=/etc/candlepin/certs
   UPSTREAM_CERTS_HOME=$CERTS_HOME/upstream
   CA_KEY_PASSWORD=$CERTS_HOME/candlepin-ca-password.txt
   CA_KEY=$CERTS_HOME/candlepin-ca.key
   CA_REDHAT_CERT=conf/candlepin-redhat-ca.crt
   CA_UPSTREAM_CERT=$UPSTREAM_CERTS_HOME/candlepin-redhat-ca.crt
   CA_PUB_KEY=$CERTS_HOME/candlepin-ca-pub.key
   CA_CERT=$CERTS_HOME/candlepin-ca.crt
   KEYSTORE=$CERTS_HOME/keystore

   sudo su -c "echo $RANDOM > $CA_KEY_PASSWORD"
   sudo openssl genrsa -out $CA_KEY -passout "file:$CA_KEY_PASSWORD" 1024
   sudo openssl rsa -pubout -in $CA_KEY -out $CA_PUB_KEY
   sudo openssl req -new -x509 -days 7305 -key $CA_KEY -out $CA_CERT -subj "/CN=$HOSTNAME/C=US/L=Raleigh/"
   sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -in $CA_CERT -inkey $CA_KEY -out $KEYSTORE -name tomcat -CAfile $CA_CERT -caname root -chain -password pass:password
   sudo cp $CA_REDHAT_CERT $CA_UPSTREAM_CERT
   sudo chmod a+r $KEYSTORE

3. Deploy your hacked Candlepin with a fresh database and test data (See the
   buildconf/scripts/import_products.rb and buildconf/scripts/test_data.json
   for examples).

4. Register to your hacked Candlepin and attach to a pool. It doesn't really
   matter which pool because all your entitlements are going to last a long
   time thanks to step 1. E.g.

   subscription-manager register --user admin --pass admin --org admin
   subscription-manager list --all --available
   subscription-manager attach --pool=blah_pool

5. Take your entitlement cert and key and cat them together. E.g.

   cat /etc/pki/entitlement/blah.pem /etc/pki/entitlement/blah-key.pem > /tmp/test-entitlement.pem

6. Copy the test-entitlement.pem file to spec/data/spec/test-entitlement.pem and copy all
   the candlepin-ca files (don't forget the password file!) under /etc/candlepin/certs to
   spec/data/CA. You are now done.
