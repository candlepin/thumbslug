# Thumbslug needs a lot of SSL certs in place for spec testing.
# Rather than generate them at test time, we have them stored in the repo.
# If you need to regenerate them, this is how!


# create a CA that will sign the cdn cert:

      -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout spec/data/CA/cdn-ca-key.pem -out \
      spec/data/CA/cdn-ca.pem


# create a cert for the cdn, and sign it with the CA cert from above:
openssl req \
  -new -newkey rsa:1024 -nodes \
    -subj '/CN=www.mycdn.com/C=US/L=Raleigh' \
      -keyout spec/data/cdn-key.pem -out spec/data/cdn.pem.req
